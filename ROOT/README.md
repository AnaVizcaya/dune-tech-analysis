# Persistent ROOT Environment Setup for JupyterHub (TLJH)

This repository provides a shell script to create a **persistent Conda environment** with the [CERN ROOT](https://root.cern) framework, designed for use in environments like **The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)**.

The environment is created under your home directory so it **survives server restarts**, and it is automatically registered as a Jupyter kernel for convenient use in notebooks.

   ```bash
   conda config --set channel_priority strict
